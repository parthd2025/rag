## Slide 2: What Does This System Do?
**Simple Question & Answer from Documents**

- Upload your documents (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Text, Markdown)
- Ask questions about the content
- Get answers with exact source references

**Example:**
- Upload: Employee handbook PDF  
- Ask: "What is the vacation policy?"  
- Get: Answer + page reference from handbook

---

## Slide 3: System Architecture & How It Works
**Complete Working System**

```
Frontend (Streamlit) ↔ Backend (FastAPI) ↔ AI Engine
     ↓                      ↓                ↓
Chat Interface      FAISS Database    Groq AI
```

**Process:**
1. Upload Document → Split into chunks → Create embeddings → Store in FAISS
2. Ask Question → Search relevant chunks → Generate AI answer → Show sources

**Built Components:**
- FastAPI server (499 lines) + Streamlit frontend (438 lines)
- Document processing + Vector search + AI integration

---

## Slide 4: Key Features Implemented
**What Users Can Actually Do**

🤖 **Chat Interface**
- Type questions naturally
- Get instant responses  
- Keep conversation history

📁 **Document Management** 
- Upload multiple files at once (drag & drop)
- View all uploaded documents
- Remove documents when needed

🔍 **Smart Search**
- Finds relevant sections across all documents
- Shows confidence scores
- Provides exact source references

---

## Slide 5: Technical Implementation
**What's Under the Hood**

**Backend Components:**
- `main.py` - REST API server (499 lines)
- `rag_engine.py` - Core AI logic (351 lines)  
- `vectorstore.py` - Search database (200+ lines)
- `ingest.py` - Document processing (250+ lines)

**Project Statistics:**
- 1,500+ lines of working code
- 21 files created, 5 main directories
- Production-ready architecture with logging & error handling

---

## Slide 6: Challenges Faced & Solutions
**Problems We Solved During Development**

🔧 **Technical Challenges:**
- **Document Processing**: Different file formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX) → Built universal document ingestor
- **Memory Management**: Large documents causing crashes → Implemented chunking strategy
- **Search Speed**: Slow similarity search → Integrated FAISS for sub-second responses

💡 **Integration Challenges:**
- **API Reliability**: Groq API rate limits → Added retry logic and error handling
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: CORS issues → Configured proper middleware
- **File Upload**: Large file handling → Added size limits and progress indicators

🎯 **User Experience Challenges:**
- **Source Attribution**: Users needed to verify answers → Added clickable source references
- **Response Time**: Users expect instant answers → Optimized vector search pipeline

---

## Slide 7: User Experience
**How People Use It**
