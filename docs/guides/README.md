# Guides

Use this directory for procedural runbooks, onboarding tutorials, or troubleshooting playbooks. Organize guides by prefixing filenames with the domain they cover (for example, `ops-deployment.md` or `frontend-testing.md`).

Before adding a new guide, check whether the topic already exists; if it does, extend the existing document instead of creating duplicates.
