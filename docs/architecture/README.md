# Architecture Documentation

This section consolidates the system and data flow diagrams that describe how the RAG platform operates. Each Markdown file captures a specific perspective:

- `API_FLOWS.md` – REST entry points and their interactions with services.
- `DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` – Storage layout, vector indices, and persistence strategy.
- `INDEX.md` – High-level directory of architecture artefacts.
- `SYSTEM_PROCESSES.md` – Operational lifecycles and background jobs.

When you update the platform architecture, either amend an existing document or add a new, clearly named file within this folder. Diagrams that are generated from external tools should have their source files committed alongside exported images or links.
